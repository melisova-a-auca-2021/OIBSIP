            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Hello! I am Aizhan, a passionate student of Software Engineering department. 
                At 21 years old, I'm on an exciting journey to explore the world of technology and development.<br>
                <br>
                I've recently embarked on my web development and Android app development journey, 
                and I'm already captivated by the endless possibilities of these fields. My curiosity 
                and drive to learn keep me motivated to push the boundaries of what I can create.<br>
                <br>
                When I'm not immersed in code or debugging, you'll find me with my nose in a good book, 
                constantly expanding my knowledge. I'm also an avid cyclist who enjoys the freedom of the 
                open road and the clarity of mind that comes with it.<br>
                <br>
                This website is a space where I can share my experiences, projects, and insights as I continue 
                to grow in the world of software development. Join me on this adventure, and let's learn and create together!</p>

                <h3>2048 Game</h3>
                <p>Explore my take on the classic 2048 puzzle game, where players slide numbered tiles 
                    to combine them and reach the coveted 2048 tile. This project challenged me to implement 
                    game logic and design a user-friendly interface. The code was written entirely in Java programming language</p>

                <h3> 15 Puzzle</h3>
                <p>Experience the classic 15 puzzle game, where players arrange sliding tiles in numerical order. 
                    My implementation of this game was an exercise in algorithmic thinking and user interface design.
                    The code was also written in Java, utilizing the Processing library</p>
